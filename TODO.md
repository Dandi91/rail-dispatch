- Add speed restrictions to routing signals
  - Maybe split signals into chain and routing types (i.e., automatically vs. manually operating)
  - Allow assigning speed restrictions in level config to every path of routing signals separately
  - Implement routes? Predefine routes in level config as a chain of switches and their positions?
- Adjust train behavior when approaching a closed signal. Try to target stop position more precisely at lower speeds.
- Increase the number of approach blocks in spawner for more realistic behavior
  - On spawn, check if all approach blocks are free. Additional blocks allow spawned train to stop if exit is blocked.
  - On despawn, additional blocks allow the entry signal to correctly cycle red-yellow-green.
