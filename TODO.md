- Add speed restrictions to routing signals
  - Maybe split signals into chain and routing types (i.e., automatically vs. manually operating)
  - Allow assigning speed restrictions in level config to every path of routing signals separately
  - Implement routes? Predefine routes in level config as a chain of switches and their positions?
- Add debug menu commands on right-click. Use it to spawn trains, open/close signals, move switches, etc.
- Adjust train behavior when approaching a closed signal. Try to target stop position more precisely at lower speeds.
