- Add actual lamps on the board image. This will make it easier to mark section breaks, signal bases, and other things.
  + Make lamp positions transparent so that we can put a colored lamp sprite behind them.
- Adjust train behavior when approaching a closed signal. Try to target stop position more precisely at lower speeds.
- Add debug menu commands on right-click. Use it to spawn trains, open/close signals, move switches, etc.
